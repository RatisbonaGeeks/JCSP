The best elements of C++, Swift, Java and Python combined in one language

## Why should you use JCSP?
The language is easy to write and easy to learn. There are a lot of advantages for JCSP
* You don't have to use a semicolon at line endings (but you can)
* You can leave out curly brackets in loops and conditionals
* You don't have to specify a data type at initialization

## Compilation
The JCSP Code will be converted to C++ Code. After that, the program will be compiled with a C++ compiler (e.g. g++)

## Code example
[Here](examples/Main.jcsp) you can find a code example. The document can change during the development process!
